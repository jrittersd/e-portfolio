    text: `    The artifact I would like to choose from this course is the FMEA portion of the final project, which exemplifies the program outcome of Quality and Regulatory. Maintaining quality and reliability in a healthcare organization is an active process that incorporates technology, people, the environment, and the organization to be successful. Analyzing a process flow and performing an FMEA incorporates these four components to understand how different failure modes can affect patient safety and quality of care. 
        For my project, which proposes a centralized governance program to manage the incorporation and monitoring of AI-based technologies in healthcare settings, I needed to perform an FMEA for a five-step process flow that tracked potential failures during the implementation of these technologies from their development through clinical integration and monitoring. These errors included software/hardware issues, problems with clinical training and clinician buy-in, concerns over patient acceptance, and, importantly, reporting and reviewing errors. I think this last point is fundamental to any quality improvement plan, regardless of the application. A healthcare organization must implement a system that promotes confidential, timely, and accurate reporting of errors and omissions to ensure high-quality, safe, and reliable patient care. This FMEA project taught me the value of breaking each step in a process flow down, identifying potential failure modes, assessing them for their criticality, and implementing measures to mitigate and control them.
