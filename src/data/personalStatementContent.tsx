export const personalStatementContent = `    Pursuing a Master's in Health Care Informatics (MSHCI) at the University of San Diego has been a journey of personal and professional growth. Building on my Bachelor's degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences from the University of California, Irvine, I entered the program eager to deepen my understanding of the Health IT industry and develop technical skills applicable to Electronic Health Record (EHR) development and data analytics. While this program provided a comprehensive overview of the Health Informatics landscape and a conceptual introduction to the technical underpinnings of the industry, I found myself yearning for more advanced, specialized knowledge that better aligned with my career aspirations. 
    Recognizing the program's interdisciplinary nature and its emphasis on theoretical coursework, I proactively sought additional opportunities to enhance my technical skillset. I enrolled in a data analytics certificate program at the University of California, Berkeley, followed by a Master's program in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. These two programs have enabled me to build a robust foundation in software engineering and data science, which I aim to integrate with the broad healthcare knowledge I gained in the MSHCI program. My goal is to leverage this combined skill set to pursue a career focused on software development in the healthcare industry. After graduating from USD, I plan to focus entirely on advancing my career as a data engineer while finishing my Master's in Computer Science. Once I've gained a few more years of experience, and with my two Master's degrees in hand, I look forward to exploring new career opportunities as a software or data engineer in the health-tech space.
