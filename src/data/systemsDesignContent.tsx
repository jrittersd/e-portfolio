    text: `    My Preventative Care & Screening for Depression Project Proposal satisfies the MSHCI Program Objective of System Design & Management by implementing value-based care in a healthcare organization through an actionable project plan with specific deliverables, documentation, and stakeholder involvement. 
        This project was completed for HCIN 600: Population Health Analytics and proposes the development of registries and clinical decision support tools to facilitate screening for depression in primary care settings. The goal of these interventions is to improve access to preventative mental health services, especially in marginalized communities. This artifact merges the project proposal document and presentation detailing the recommendations for implementing the proposed interventions, including the inception of a registry to track patient screenings, new clinical decision support tools, and adequate training to accommodate changes to the workflow. Additionally, the project plan performs a rudimentary cost-benefit analysis to justify the new intervention at the organizational level. `,
