    name: "GOTV! Get Out the Vaccine!",
    text: `    This artifact, the Get Out the Vaccine! project proposal demonstrates my understanding of ethical leadership, strategic planning, change management, and large-scale program design. This fictional proposal was developed in 2020 in anticipation of one of the largest mass vaccination campaigns in U.S. history. It exemplifies ethical leadership and strategic planning, implementing the CDC's recommendations for risk-based vaccine prioritization with a phased delivery approach designed to mitigate the logistical barriers expected during the initial phases of vaccine delivery.
        With clinical decision support as the foundation of this proposal, this project presented numerous challenges, including EHR integration concerns, data security considerations, stakeholder recruiting, clinical workflow disruptions, staff training requirements, and patient buy-in. This detailed proposal aims to incorporate effective strategies to manage these concerns and ensure a smooth implementation on a strict timeline. This project showcases skills I developed in this program to design and implement complex systems that integrate human, technological, and organizational elements with a measured and ethical approach. `,

    name: "Speech Recognition Implementation Group Project",
    text: `    This artifact, the Project Plan for the Speech Recognition Group Project, further demonstrates my ethical leadership and strategic program management skills. In this project, a team of four other MSHCI students and I designed a complete project plan for a fictional clinic looking to implement Speech-to-Text clinical documentation tools. As project manager, I was responsible for defining the project's scope, goals, and phases, arranging the various components of the project plan, and facilitating communication and collaboration between my team members.
        I felt fortunate to join a team of like-minded and diligent peers who executed on their deliverables and engaged in thoughtful and constructive dialogue. Together, we formulated a comprehensive analysis of the resource requirements, risks, success metrics, and stakeholders involved. This process enabled us to define a practical and efficient work breakdown structure and make informed strategic decisions regarding resource allocation. This experience refined my ability to lead multidisciplinary teams and apply leadership principles to solve complex technical and organizational challenges. `,

    name: "Applied Leadership: Medibyte Sleep Device Workshop",
    text: `    TThis artifact, the Medibyte Sleep Device Workshop presentation, showcases the application of the leadership skills that I developed in the MSHCI program. In this project, I designed and conducted an educational workshop at a dental clinic to train clinical staff members on a new medical device for sleep apnea testing, supporting the introduction of a new service at the clinic. While the tool was relatively simple to use and administer, this project gave me the opportunity to apply my knowledge of change management theory in a clinical setting. I conducted an interactive and informative workshop for staff members that aimed to build confidence in the new device and increase understanding of its operation, intending to ensure a smooth implementation of the incoming sleep apnea testing service.
        This project required me to work with a team of clinical and non-clinical staff; it tested my ethical leadership skills in navigating my team's diverse personalities and backgrounds. While I focused on taking an inclusive and empathetic approach to managing the team, I had to learn how to manage friction within the team, using the Fisher & Ury theoretical approach to conflict management. To me, this artifact highlights the human side of leadershipâ€”emphasizing qualities such as empathy, respect, kindness, and unwavering focus on supporting and empowering others. `,
