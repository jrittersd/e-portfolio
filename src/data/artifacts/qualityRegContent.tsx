    name: "MACRA & Health IT",
    text: `    This artifact, titled "Macra Drives EHR Interoperability," was a written assignment for HCIN 552: Electronic Medical Record Systems and demonstrates my understanding of the regulatory environment surrounding healthcare informatics and how quality improvement drives technological innovation in the field. In this paper, I analyzed how the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) incentivizes healthcare organizations to adopt or implement interoperable EHR systems that improve quality of care, patient safety, and outcomes. 
        This project explores how the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) provided financial incentives to providers for meeting performance and quality metrics enabled by EHR systems. This relationship between financial incentives and quality benchmarking is foundational in the healthcare regulatory environment, as it enables regulatory bodies to address critical operational challenges in the healthcare landscape effectively. This paper articulates the relationship between how MACRA and MIPS facilitated the adoption of standardized and interoperable EHR systems, allowing for seamless patient data exchange between healthcare organizations using disparate technological systems. 
            This artifact highlights my ability to evaluate the regulatory landscape and its role in shaping innovation and technological adoption in the healthcare informatics industry. It demonstrates my knowledge of the interplay between regulations, technology, and quality improvement, which come together to ensure effective and secure patient care. This paper highlights my ability to connect policy-driven incentives to technological outcomes, aiming to meet and exceed quality standards and regulatory requirements. `,

    name: "AI in Healthcare: The Risk of Insufficient Governance,",
    text: `    This artifact, titled "AI in Healthcare: The Risk of Insufficient Governance," was my course project for HCIN 559: Management of Health Care System Quality Outcomes and Patient Safety. This project demonstrates my ability to address gaps in the regulatory environment, design quality management programs, and propose effective solutions that ensure compliance, quality, and safety in the Health IT industry. 
        In this project, I identified the lack of central oversight regarding the bourgeoning field of AI-based technologies in healthcare as a potential patient safety risk and recommended the formation of a comprehensive regulatory organization to manage the relationship between AI-based technology vendors and healthcare providers. This project specifically identifies an evidence-based quality management system framework that champions (1) technical and procedural documentation, (2) continuous monitoring and risk management, (3) structured error reporting mechanisms, and (4) a culture of quality, reliability, transparency, compliance, and innovation that fosters trust between vendors, providers, and patients. Additionally, in an effort to enable AI algorithm refinement and development, this project proposes a standardized implementation of the HL7-FHIR data-sharing protocol to allow providers to share de-identified health data with vendors, facilitating further innovation in the industry while maintaining patient safety and confidentiality.
            This project features an extensive FMEA and process flow, which identifies the role that the proposed regulatory bodies would play in reducing and managing risk to quality and patient safety. Combined, these processes form the backbone of the proposed Quality Measurement Plan, which highlights my understanding of performance improvement programs and the tools required to evaluate system outcomes. This artifact aligns directly with the Quality and Regulatory program outcome by showcasing my ability to design comprehensive governance systems, apply risk management techniques, and promote technological innovation through a framework that enables monitoring, reporting, and feedback. This artifact reflects my steadfast appreciation for the role that regulatory organizations play in upholding patient safety and quality.  `,

    name: "Speech Recognition Project - Post Implementation Evaluation",
    text: `    The artifact, titled "Speech Recognition Project Plan: Post-Implementation Evaluation," was part of a larger project plan completed with a group of my peers in HCIN 542: Systems Analysis and Design for Health Care Informatics. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate quality measurements with systems evaluations in a post-implementation framework that assesses the project's execution alongside various patient safety, data quality, and security metrics. 
        This project proposes a Natural Language Processing (NLP) powered speech recognition system to assist clinical documentation at a hypothetical community health center. In this post-implementation evaluation, my group assessed the general reception of the new tool, justified its implementation through a cost-benefit analysis, identified key network and hardware upgrade requirements, and evaluated the phased implementation approach. Particularly, this analysis focused on the system's outputs, evaluating the tool's usefulness alongside the intended improvement in quality of care. This analysis also considered data quality and integrity concerns, guaranteeing personal health information and patient confidentiality through HIPAA-compliant data collection mechanisms.
            This artifact illustrates my ability to integrate quality measurement and systems evaluation in a comprehensive post-implementation framework that ensures a system delivers the intended benefits while meeting patient safety and data integrity standards. While more general in its scope, this artifact aligns closely with the Quality and Regulatory program outcome, assessing the validity of human-technology integrations in systems designed to uphold data integrity, optimize performance, and enhance overall healthcare delivery.  `,
