    name: "CDS Design for COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation",
    text: `    This artifact, titled "Using Clinical Decision Support to Facilitate Equitable Allocation of the COVID-19 Vaccine," was my final project for HCIN 552: Electronic Medical Record System and proposes a clinical decision support (CDS) tool that orchestrates the phased allocation of this vaccine per the framework set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This project, inspired by the mass vaccination campaign that ensued during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, demonstrates my understanding of Systems Design and Management and articulates an example of healthcare system design. By aligning the proposed CDS tool with the CDC's framework for equitable allocation, this project demonstrates how a data-driven algorithm can facilitate an attempt to minimize disparities in healthcare access and manage the potential chaos that could ensue in one of the largest mass vaccination campaigns in American history. 
        This project details a comprehensive approach to a phased vaccine delivery system that uses a CDS tool to orchestrate patient scheduling at a hypothetical community pharmacy. This project integrates my understanding of program management and systems design alongside CDS tool and algorithm development. Furthermore, this project illustrates my knowledge of the human side of health technology integration via a thorough evaluation of the proposal's planning, development, training, implementation, and evaluation phases. This program development structure is integral to systems design in health informatics, as it enables streamlined integration of technology into clinical workflows, ensuring operational efficiency, reducing cognitive burden on clinicians, and maintaining quality in patient care.
            A well-designed system that incorporates extensive monitoring and evaluation is essential in ensuring widespread adoption and long-term success. This project underscores my ability to design technologically sound and human-centered systems, addressing the practical challenges that face patients and providers, especially in mission-critical situations like the one described in this project. This project reflects the critical role of systems design and the value of clinical decision support tools in improving healthcare delivery, reducing provider burden, maintaining equity in healthcare delivery, and, most importantly, improving patient outcomes in a complex and rapidly evolving healthcare industry.
