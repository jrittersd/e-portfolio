    name: "CDS Design for COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation",
    text: `    This artifact, titled "Using Clinical Decision Support to Facilitate Equitable Allocation of the COVID-19 Vaccine," was my final project for HCIN 552: Electronic Medical Record System and proposes a clinical decision support (CDS) tool that orchestrates the phased allocation of this vaccine per the framework set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This project, inspired by the mass vaccination campaign that ensued during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, demonstrates my understanding of Systems Design and Management and articulates an example of healthcare system design. By aligning the proposed CDS tool with the CDC's framework for equitable allocation, this project demonstrates how a data-driven algorithm can facilitate an attempt to minimize disparities in healthcare access and manage the potential chaos that could ensue in one of the largest mass vaccination campaigns in American history. 
        This project details a comprehensive approach to a phased vaccine delivery system that uses a CDS tool to orchestrate patient scheduling at a hypothetical community pharmacy. This project integrates my understanding of program management and systems design alongside CDS tool and algorithm development. Furthermore, this project illustrates my knowledge of the human side of health technology integration via a thorough evaluation of the proposal's planning, development, training, implementation, and evaluation phases. This program development structure is integral to systems design in health informatics, as it enables streamlined integration of technology into clinical workflows, ensuring operational efficiency, reducing cognitive burden on clinicians, and maintaining quality in patient care.
            A well-designed system that incorporates extensive monitoring and evaluation is essential in ensuring widespread adoption and long-term success. This project underscores my ability to design technologically sound and human-centered systems, addressing the practical challenges that face patients and providers, especially in mission-critical situations like the one described in this project. This project reflects the critical role of systems design and the value of clinical decision support tools in improving healthcare delivery, reducing provider burden, maintaining equity in healthcare delivery, and, most importantly, improving patient outcomes in a complex and rapidly evolving healthcare industry.

    name: "FMEA: AI in Healthcare White Paper",
    text: `    This artifact, titled "AI in Healthcare: The Risk of Insufficient Governance - FMEA," was a significant portion of my white paper and course project for HCIN 559: Management of Health Care System Quality Outcomes and Patient Safety. In this project, I proposed a governance board to maintain quality and oversight for AI-based technologies in the health informatics industry. This document exemplifies my understanding of Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) as it relates to system design and its important role in maintaining quality in healthcare delivery. 
        The flowchart presented in this artifact outlines the FMEA process flow from the initial stages of AI tool development through the governance board's approval process, provider uptake, implementation, and evaluation. From hardware updates to user training and error reporting, the FMEA methodology enabled me to identify and propose solutions for potential sources of medical or technological errors that could impact patient safety. This comprehensive approach highlights the interplay between technological systems and organizational management, ensuring that the integration of new tools is safe and effective. This structured approach is essential in healthcare informatics, where complex technological systems play an integral role in patient care delivery. This project highlights my understanding of human and technological systems integration. It provides evidence of my knowledge of the FMEA methodology and its role in maintaining quality and safety in patient care settings.

    name: "Preventative Care & Screening for Depression - System Design Proposal",
    text: `    This artifact, titled "Preventative Care and Screening for Depression," was my final project for HCIN 600: Population Health Analytics and consisted of a project proposal for a value-based care intervention aimed at introducing preventative screenings for depression in patients at a hypothetical community health center. This project demonstrates my understanding of human and technology systems integration and provides an example of a healthcare system design. 
        This project proposal comprises a comprehensive plan that defines the needs of a target population, performs a cost-benefit analysis, proposes a CDS-based intervention and the appropriate workflow modifications, and identifies metrics for continued evaluation. I used a common methodology called SBAR (situation, background, assessment, recommendation) to identify the need for and justify the creation of this proposed clinical intervention. After thoroughly reviewing the organizational and human-based systems affected by the proposed intervention, I aimed to define the intervention's intended impact on population health via a framework asking Who? What? When? How? and By Whom?. Once this analysis was completed, I embarked on a workflow analysis that aimed to identify gaps in care and understand how the proposed intervention could improve clinical workflows and access to preventative screenings for depression. This entire process led me to my technological proposal, which incorporated an evidence-based clinical depression survey instrument and registry to track depression screenings and help coordinate access to further care. 
            This artifact highlights my understanding of key systems design principles, especially the development of targeted interventions that support clinical decision-making, streamline workflows, and enhance value-based patient care. It demonstrates my ability to align clinical needs with technological solutions that aim to address gaps in patient care. This human-technical integration is central to the field of health informatics and exemplifies my understanding of the program outcome for Systems Design and Management. It underscores the value of health IT in improving access to preventative care, enabling timely interventions, and supporting long-term mental health care management in primary care settings. `,
