    name: "Electronic Health Records Theory & Practice",
    text: `    This artifact, my final exam for HCIN 552: Electronic Medical Record (EMR) Systems, demonstrates my foundational knowledge of health information technology, particularly in implementing and managing EMRs. This document highlights my broad understanding of the various technical and human systems integrated by an EMR. Through this artifact, I explored the technological and organizational considerations necessary for successful EHR Implementation; on the technical side, EHR systems must sustain data integrity, data/cybersecurity, patient safety, and usability.
        Organizations play a crucial role in facilitating the adoption of these technologies among clinicians and patients while establishing safeguards to maintain high levels of patient quality and safety and improve clinical workflows. This document also provides insight into the clinical workflow analysis process, which forms the foundation for clinical decision support toolsâ€”the epitome of human-technology systems integration. These tools must be designed to improve clinical workflow, maintain patient safety, reduce cognitive burden, and honor the high-stakes environment in which clinicians often work. Information Technology forms the backbone of many healthcare organizations in the United States, enabling the continued integration of human-technical systems. `,

    name: "SQL Technical Exam",
    text: `    This document, a portion of my final exam for HCIN 543: Database & Knowledge Management, demonstrates my knowledge of Structured Querying Language (SQL) in the context of information technology. SQL databases are ubiquitous in software applications since they provide a relational and structured format for data storage. This artifact holds a special place in my heart since this class inspired my career in data engineering. While this course focused primarily on extracting and aggregating data using SQL for further analysis, I found myself more intrigued by the database engineering process. After completing this course, I began pursuing advanced topics in data and software engineering.
        This document provides sample code written for Microsoft Access, which was required in this course. The queries displayed here are unique to Access-SQL, considering they list all tables involved in the query inside the FROM clause instead of using JOIN clauses, as in more common dialects of SQL (e.g., Postgres, MySQL, etc.). MS Access does not enforce the use of JOIN clauses in graphically linked SQL tables, allowing users to simplify queries like in this example. MS Access is a desktop database management system that provides an SQL-like interface for querying operations yet prioritizes usability over performance; once a user has defined the entity relationships for a database, the software can infer SQL JOINs implicitly. This "feature" is a holdover from the original SQL, and is not recommended in practice.
            Looking back on this exam from 2021, I feel immense pride in the technical skills I have developed in database and knowledge management, especially SQL querying and SQL database design. Importantly, I would tell the younger version of myself not to skip the JOINs since code readability is paramount in any programming language, especially a widely used language like SQL. With the exception of a handful of rudimentary SQL-based data management systems (including Microsoft Access), these queries, as written, will not run. Readable code makes information technology more accessible and reliable, facilitating the testing and debugging processes and ensuring high-quality code. `,

    name: "Machine Learning Applications in Health Care",
    text: `    This document, my course project for HCIN 615: Machine Learning Applications for Health Care, demonstrates my knowledge of the Python programming language and common data analytics libraries. This project aims to produce meaningful analytics and predict the stages of chronic kidney disease based on glomerular filtration rate using off-the-shelf machine learning functionality. This project reflects my understanding of functional programming to extract, wrangle, and visualize data using open-source Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn. Furthermore, this project reflects my knowledge of Supervised machine learning, including model selection, data preparation, and performance evaluation using the extensive SciKit-Learn library.
        These procedures, all implemented using the Python programming language, are a practical application of Information Technology in the healthcare industry. The Python programming language is integral to modern data processing and knowledge extraction, from visualizations to analytics to machine learning and predictive modeling. Furthermore, the functional approach to programming, where inputs are transformed into outputs through a series of function declarations, is incredibly valuable in Information Technology as it enables a modular and predictable coding structure that enhances code reusability, reduces unpredictable behavior, and simplifies testing and debugging. From data engineering to data analytics, this paradigm is essential in maintaining reliable, scalable, and maintainable Information Technology systems. `,
