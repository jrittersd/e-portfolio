    name: "COVID-19 Infection Rates in Minority Communities",
    text: `    This artifact, titled "COVID-19 Infection Rates in Minority Communities," was my final project for HCIN 540: Introduction to Health Care Information Management. It demonstrates my understanding of data management tools related to data analytics and knowledge management. Using publically available data manipulated with Microsoft Excel, the objective of this project was to identify disparities between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates in minority communities.
        This project involved generating a variety of visualizations that reflected the disproportionately high rates of infection in minority groups in California. Doing so required integrating various data sources into MS Excel, including COVID-19 morbidity and mortality data and census data, performing numerous filterings, calculations, and aggregations, then generating visualizations that accurately convey the vast disparities in infection rates, generally and throughout the pandemic. While a variety of more sophisticated tools enable data wrangling and visualization generation, this project reflects a strong understanding of spreadsheet mechanics and chart building using ubiquitous data management tools like MS Excel. These tools are integral to Data and Knowledge Management, enabling efficient data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and data visualization. `,

    text: `    This artifact, titled "Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System," was my final project for HCIN 543: Database Design and Knowledge Management. This project demonstrates my understanding of data collection and analytics, data management software, and knowledge management theory pertaining to the program outcome of Data and Knowledge Management. In this project, a publically available data source, the YRBSS, was obtained and imported using Microsoft Access, where complex queries aimed to relate various demographic and societal features to participant outcomes.
        This presentation provides a comprehensive overview of the data analysis and knowledge management process, detailing the data collection methodologies and feature definitions for the data source, building the database in MS Access, writing SQL queries, and generating data visualizations in MS Excel. The outputs of this process enabled a complex analysis of the various risk factors that lead to positive or negative outcomes in youth participants. This process of defining and validating data sources, employing data management software, and extracting information into visualizations that support the analysis is integral to data and knowledge management and applicable to any application of data analytics.`,
